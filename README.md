# motu_builder

Only Windows OS at present.

This helper application is intended to automate the download of netCDF (.nc) files showing tidal currents in the Western European area.

Downloading Copernicus netCDF (.nc) files with motu_builder requires registration with the CMEMS service of Copernicus. Apply here:http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/register-now/

These files can be converted to grib format using the CDO program (Climate Data Operators).

A guide to using CDO on Windows is here:
